# Playwright E2E scaffold

## Getting started

1. Install new tooling if you have not yet run `npm install` since this change. Playwright also needs the browser binaries once via `npx playwright install`.
2. Run the Angular dev server automatically through the test runner with `npm run test:e2e`. The command uses the configuration in `playwright.config.ts` and will reuse an existing server when one is already running.
3. Optional helpers are available at `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`. Import `{ test, expect }` from that module to get typed page objects for each reimbursement step and the info pages.
4. The sample reimbursement test uploads a dummy receipt and parses the generated PDF using `pdf-parse`; `npm install` fetches all required tools automatically.

## Page objects

Reusable page models live in `tests/e2e/poms`. They cover the individual reimbursement steps, modal dialogs for expenses, and the informational pages. Extend or adjust them as you add scenariosâ€”each class keeps selectors close to the component markup so tests remain readable.
